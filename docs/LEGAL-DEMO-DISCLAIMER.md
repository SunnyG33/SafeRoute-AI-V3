# Demo Mode Disclosure

This application is operating in Demo Mode. All data presented within the application, including but not limited to incidents, messages, locations, AED locations, medical summaries, and check-ins, is simulated content created for demonstration and testing purposes only.

Do not rely on this application for real-world emergency response. In an emergency, call 911 (or your local emergency number).

Production deployments must:
- Replace simulated data sources with approved, compliant systems.
- Enforce data residency, privacy, and security controls appropriate to the jurisdiction.
- Remove demo banners and badges only after validation that no simulated data remains in user-facing surfaces.
