# HERO Demos: Gap Audit (v21)

This document summarizes whatâ€™s missing in the Civilian (HERO CP) and Responder (HERO OS) demos relative to the patents, specs, and strategy files in this repository.

## Highlights

- Civilian: Voice activation, guided CPR, 911 dispatcher UX, stronger consent controls, accurate TLRT overlay, and RAPTRnav routing.
- Responder: Vitals & scene data panel (110), Access Medical Record (112) with audit and revoke, Start Incident Report (118) with export, task-level timers (116), and checklists (120/122).
- Cross-cutting: Centralized legal banners, offline-first with POST queue & retry, WCAG AA hardening, Elder Protocol Override, and PHI posture (auth, RBAC, audit logs).
